IF NOT FOR THE PRESENCE OF TEXT
PRIOR TO THE FIRST RECORD, THERE
WOULD BE NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS
ENTRY. HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF
TEXT BEFORE ANY ENTRIES SHOULD NOT
SIMPLY BE IGNORED, AS IT MAY BE THE
SIGN OF AN ERROR. IT IS BETTER TO
MARK SUCH TEXT AS AN ERROR. ANY
DESIRED TEXT SHOULD BE COMMENTED.
