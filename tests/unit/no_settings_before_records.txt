NO SETTINGS BEFORE RECORDS

SETTINGS LINES SHOULD NOT BE PLACED
OUTSIDE OF A RECORD DECLARATION.
DUE TO THE WAY RECORDS ARE
PROCESSED, THIS MEANS THAT ANY
SETTING LINE (A LINE STARTING WITH
A PERCENTAGE SIGN) SHOULD NOT
PRECEDE THE FIRST RECORD ENTRY.
THIS INDICATES A SERIOUS ERROR
THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED.
