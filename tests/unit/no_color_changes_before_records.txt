COLOR SET BEFORE RECORD
.001
LINES THAT BEGIN WITH A PERIOD ARE
USED TO SPECIFY CHANGES IN DISPLAY
COLOR.  THEY SPECIFY THE COLOR OF
THE TEXT THAT FOLLOWS THEIR LINE.
HOWEVER, ANY SUCH LINE THAT OCCURED
BEFORE AN ENTRY WOULD NOT BE READ.
IT WOULD INDICATE AN ERROR IN THE
FILE THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH
IMMEDIATELY.
