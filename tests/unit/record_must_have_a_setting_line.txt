ANOTHER ENTRY
.001
JUST TO BE THOROUGH THERE IS ALSO
A SECOND ENTRY BUT IT WILL NOT
MATTER BECAUSE AN ERROR WILL OCCUR
FOR THE FIRST.
BE RESPONSIBLE AND CHECK THAT EACH
RECORD HAS A VALID SETTING LINE.
IT IS THE ONE THAT STARTS WITH THE
PERCENT SIGN FOLLOWED BY TWO
DIGITS THEN A COLON AND THEN AN
ADDITIONAL DIGIT.
THIS TEXT DOES NOT MATTER IT IS
JUST TEXT.
